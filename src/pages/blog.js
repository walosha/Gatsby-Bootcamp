        My other friend that went with me congratulated me and for a minute, I
        was totally blank. I knew I wasnâ€™t interested in Mathematics, I had
        always wanted some kind of Engineering courses and yes my first choice
        was petroleum engineering. It was at this point I knew my passion and
        ambition might not go as I have planned and I had made up my mind not to
        resume at Ibadan.{" "}
